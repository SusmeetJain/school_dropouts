# Girl Student Dropouts
## Exploring patterns in female student dropouts in India

## Objective
Indian Government has been successfull in enrolling students at the elementary levels, yet a significant number of students dropout before reaching higher classes, this remains a major challenge for education in India.

My motivation for this project comes from a visit to a NGO called Sewa Rural in Gujarat as a part of the Narmada Prerna Yatra. One of their divisions is doing amazing work in helping girls continue schooling once they reach adolescence.

This project is an attempt to take a data driven approach to explore the problem that this NGO is trying to address.

## Data
The data is obtained from the Government of India's official data repository, data.gov.in.
The data is highly dispersed in different excel sheets. Multiple sheets from different sources have been combined in order to generate useful insights.

## Results
 - A lot less girls are enrolled in schools to even start with. This gap quickly escalates around class 6th. The percentage decline in enrollment going to next class from the previous become much higher for girls then boys.
 - States that have a bigger percentage of schools with toilets are able to retain more girls through higher classes. This correlation can clearly be observerd in the upward trend in the following graph. 
 Each point in the graph represents one state!

## Next Steps
 - There have been some limitations to the availability of data as an individual but if you are an research organisation you are eligible to apply for raw data from the DISE. (link shared below)
